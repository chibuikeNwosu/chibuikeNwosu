### Web Developer | Designer | Problem Solver  

I’m an 18-year-old student at Griffith College Dublin, a passionate web developer and designer. My mission is to help small and large businesses harness the untapped potential of the internet to scale their operations, boost profits, and expand their reach.I specialize in creating user-friendly websites that not only look great but also deliver an enjoyable and seamless experience for users.  

I also enjoy solving challenging problems and building innovative applications. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring my hobbies or shooting hoops. 🏀
